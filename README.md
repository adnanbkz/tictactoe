Tic Tac Toe in Java 🎮

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe in Java project! This repository is designed as a hands-on tutorial for beginners who want to learn the fundamentals of programming in Java by building a simple yet functional game.
📖 Description

This project features the classic Tic Tac Toe game developed in Java. Through this project, you will learn:

    How to handle user input using the Scanner class.
    Working with 2D arrays to manage the game board.
    Implementing conditional logic to check for game outcomes (win, draw, or ongoing).
    Structuring a program into reusable methods for clean and maintainable code.

🚀 Features

    Two-player gameplay: Play with a friend on the same device.
    Interactive interface: Players take turns entering their moves.
    Winner detection: The game announces the winner or a draw when the board is full.
    Simple, clean code: Designed for educational purposes, focusing on readability and basic programming practices.

📦 Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

    Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
    A code editor or IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code.
    Basic knowledge of Java syntax and concepts.

🛠️ Setup Instructions

    Clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe-java.git  

    Open the project in your preferred IDE.
    Compile and run the Main.java file to start the game.

📚 How to Play

    The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
    Players take turns entering the row and column where they want to place their marker (X or O).
    The game announces a winner if a player aligns three of their markers in a row, column, or diagonal.
    If all spots are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.

🌱 Learning Objectives

This project is perfect for beginners to learn:

    How to use loops for game flow.
    Basic error handling to prevent invalid input.
    The importance of modular programming by dividing logic into methods.
    Basic concepts of conditionals and loops in Java.

🏆 Challenges

If you're feeling adventurous, try implementing these additional features:

    AI Player: Add an option for single-player mode with basic AI.
    Input Validation: Ensure users can’t enter invalid moves (e.g., out-of-range or occupied cells).
    Custom Board Size: Allow players to choose the board size (e.g., 4x4 or 5x5).
    Score Tracking: Keep track of scores across multiple games.
